# Capstone_SuraHealth

This project aims to analyze the availability of emergency rooms in Surakarta using data from SIRANAP, the National Hospital Registry database. The problem statement is that Surakarta, like many other cities in Indonesia, faces challenges in ensuring all residents have access to emergency medical services. The research questions focused on the distribution of emergency rooms in Surakarta, the capacity of the rooms, and how accessible they are for different populations.
